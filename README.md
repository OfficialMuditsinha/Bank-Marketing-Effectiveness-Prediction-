# Bank marketing Effectiveness Prediction

# Problem Statement
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls.

The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).
