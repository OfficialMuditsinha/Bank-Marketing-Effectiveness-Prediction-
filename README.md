# Bank marketing Effectiveness Prediction

# Problem Statement
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).
# Data Cleaning
* The data received here is very messy, it's column name and values were not perfectly aligned. By observation it was seen that every value were seperated by a ";". So used excel and split the enteries by delimeter feature using ";" delimeter.
